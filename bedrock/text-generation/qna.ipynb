    "\n",
    "You can find the recommended tire pressure specifications on the inflation label located on the driver's side B-pillar of your vehicle. Alternatively, you can refer to your vehicle's manual for this information. The recommended tire pressure may vary depending on the speed and the number of occupants or maximum load in the vehicle.\n",

    "Reinflating the tires:\n",

    "When checking tire pressure, it is important to do so when the tires are cold. This means allowing the vehicle to sit for at least three hours to ensure the tires are at the same temperature as the ambient temperature.\n",

    "To reinflate the tires:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Check the recommended tire pressure for your vehicle.\n",
